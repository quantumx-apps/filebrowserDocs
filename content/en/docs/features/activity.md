{{% alert context="warning" %}}
**v2.0.0 only**

The Activity Viewer and semantic activity audit log were introduced in **v2.0.0**. They require the SQLite database migration from v1.x. If you are still on v1.x, see {{< doclink path="getting-started/v2/migration/" text="Migration guide" />}} before upgrading.
{{% /alert %}}

## Overview

v2.0.0 stores **semantic activity events** — downloads, uploads, share changes, logins, and similar actions — in SQLite. The **Activity Viewer** turns that history into a searchable table, interactive charts, and CSV exports.

This feature depends on the v2 write-through **state** layer and structured SQL storage introduced in v2.0.0. Events are buffered in memory and written to SQLite in batches. By default, there can be a **short delay** (up to **10 seconds**) before a new event appears in the Activity Viewer — events sit in an in-memory buffer until the next flush. Old rows are purged automatically based on retention settings (**30 days** by default).

## Opening the Activity Viewer

There are several ways to open the tool:

1. **Tools menu** — Open **Tools** from the sidebar and choose **Activity Viewer** (`/tools/activityViewer`).
2. **Settings shortcuts** — Admins see an activity button on:
   - **Settings → Users** — user create/update/delete events
   - **Settings → Shares** — share lifecycle and share downloads
   - **Settings → API Tokens** — token create/delete events
   - **Settings → Access** — access rule changes for the selected source
3. **Context shortcuts** — While browsing or editing:
   - **File info** — activity for the current file or folder
   - **Share editor** — activity for a specific share or path
   - **Access editor** — access changes for the current path

Shortcuts open the viewer with filters pre-filled (scope, source, path, share hash, or event types).

## Who can see what

| Capability | Admin | Non-admin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| View all users' activity | Yes | No — only their own rows |
| Filter by username | Yes | No |
| Path glob filter (`pathGlob`) | Yes | No |
| Share filter on others' shares | Yes | Only shares they own |
| Full paths in results | Yes | Paths trimmed to their per-source scope |
| CSV `details` column (JSON) | Yes | No |

Non-admin users always query with their own user ID enforced on the server. Admins can filter by any username, including the anonymous user.

## Activity scopes

Scopes limit which event types appear. Use them in the viewer or in API query parameters.

| Scope | Includes |
| --- | --- |
| **all** | Every event type (default) |
| **files** | Download, move, copy, rename, upload, delete, bulk delete, archive, unarchive |
| **access** | Access create, update, delete |
| **shares** | Share create, update, delete, and **download** events tied to a share (via `shareHash` in details) |

## View types

The Activity Viewer supports five layouts:

- **Table** — Paginated list with optional columns (source, path, share hash, token name, IP address). Click a row for full event details.
- **Bar chart** — Counts over time, split by event type, user, or total.
- **Line chart** — Same time-series data as the bar chart in line form.
- **Pie chart** — Distribution of counts for the selected range and filters.
- **Summary** — Aggregated totals without a time axis.

<img src="/images/features/activity/chart-by-user.png" alt="Activity bar chart split by user">

Chart views support time buckets of **minute** (up to 48 hours), **hour**, or **day** (ranges up to 90 days). Split-by options include event type, user (admins only), or total.

## What gets logged

Activity covers file operations from the Web UI, administration, authentication, and tool usage. Web UI file changes (move, copy, rename, upload, delete, archive) are fully recorded.

### File and path operations

| Event type | Triggered by |
|---|---|
| **download** | Web UI or API download (`/api/resources/download`), including share and token-based downloads |
| **upload** | New file or folder upload (Web UI or WebDAV `MKCOL`) |
| **move**, **copy**, **rename** | Resource PATCH actions (Web UI) |
| **delete**, **bulkDelete** | Single or multi-item deletion (Web UI or WebDAV delete) |
| **archive**, **unarchive** | Archive tool actions |

Web UI operations on files and folders — including multi-select delete, drag-and-drop move/copy, and archive/unarchive — produce the corresponding activity rows with source, path, and field-level details where applicable.

### Shares and access

| Event type | Triggered by |
|---|---|
| **shareCreate**, **shareUpdate**, **shareDelete** | Share lifecycle (field-level changes on update) |
| **accessCreate**, **accessUpdate**, **accessDelete** | Per-path access rules |

Share **downloads** appear as **download** events with `details.shareHash` set. The share's download counter and per-user limits are updated separately in share state (not duplicate audit rows).

### Users, tokens, and auth

| Event type | Triggered by |
|---|---|
| **userCreate**, **userUpdate**, **userDelete** | User administration (scope and permission changes appear in details) |
| **tokenCreate**, **tokenDelete** | API token lifecycle |
| **login**, **logout**, **signup** | Authentication events |
| **passkeyRegister**, **passkeyDelete** | Passkey changes |

### Tools

| Event type | Triggered by |
|---|---|
| **duplicateFinder** | Duplicate finder tool runs |

### WebDAV

WebDAV **write** operations are logged when performed by an authenticated user:

| WebDAV operation | Activity event |
|---|---|
| Create directory (`MKCOL`) | **upload** |
| Delete (`DELETE`) | **delete** |
| Rename / move | **move** |

WebDAV **reads** (file GET) and directory listings are **not** logged as activity today. Use Web UI or API downloads for audited download history.

Each row stores the actor username, event type, timestamp, client IP, auth method (web session vs API key), and structured **details** (paths, share hash, field diffs, and so on). Admins see the richest detail in the UI and in CSV export.

## What is not logged

These actions do **not** create activity rows:

- **Inline viewing** via `viewToken` (`GET /api/resources/view`, `GET /api/media/stream`, and related share/public endpoints) — previewing in the UI does not count as a download and is not audited as activity. See {{< doclink path="features/user-permissions/#view-vs-download" text="View vs download" />}}.
- **WebDAV file reads** — opening or copying file bytes over WebDAV does not create `download` events (WebDAV writes are logged; see above).
- **Disabled logging** — When `server.database.activity.disabled` is `true`, new events are not recorded (existing rows remain until retention purge).

Ordinary **downloads** through the Web UI or `/api/resources/download` (including forced download and folder archives) are logged as **download** events.

## Configuration

Activity settings live under `server.database.activity` in `config.yaml`. Admins can tune buffering, retention, or turn logging off entirely if audit history is not needed for your deployment.

```yaml
server:
  database:
    path: "filebrowser.sqlite"
    activity:
      disabled: false              # set true to stop recording new events
      retentionDays: 30            # purge rows older than this (default 30)
      flushIntervalSeconds: 10     # background flush interval (default 10)
      maxBufferSize: 10000         # flush immediately when buffer reaches this size
```

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **`disabled`** | `false` | Set to `true` to **disable activity logging** entirely. No new events are recorded; existing rows remain until retention purge. Use this if you do not want audit history stored. |
| **`retentionDays`** | `30` | Rows older than this many days are **deleted automatically** on startup and during periodic purges. Increase for longer history; decrease to limit database growth. |
| **`flushIntervalSeconds`** | `10` | How often buffered events are **written to SQLite**. Until a flush runs, new events may not appear in the Activity Viewer or API — there can be up to this many seconds of delay after an action. Lower for near-real-time visibility; raise to reduce write frequency. |
| **`maxBufferSize`** | `10000` | When the in-memory buffer reaches this size, a flush runs **immediately** regardless of the interval. |

{{% alert context="info" %}}
Activity is **buffered**, not written synchronously on every request. After a download or admin change, wait up to **`flushIntervalSeconds`** (default **10 seconds**) before expecting the row in the viewer, unless the buffer hits **`maxBufferSize`** first.

## CSV export

In **table** view, **Export CSV** downloads activity for the current filters.

<img src="/images/features/activity/viewer-table.png" alt="Activity Viewer table view with filters">

Exports:

- Paginate through the result set in chunks (up to **100,000** rows total; larger exports are truncated with a `TRUNCATED` marker row).
- Include optional columns you enabled in the table: **source**, **path**, **shareHash**, **tokenName**.
- Include a **details** JSON column **for admins only** (full structured payload).

Base columns are always: `id`, `createdAt`, `username`, `eventType`, and `ipAddress`.

## API

Authenticated users can query activity through the REST API (same filters as the UI):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/tools/activity` | Paginated event list (`page`, `limit` up to 500) |
| `GET /api/tools/activity/grouped` | Chart buckets (`interval`, `splitBy`, `groupBy`) |
| `GET /api/tools/activity/export` | CSV stream (`rows` for optional columns) |

Query parameters include `from`, `to`, `scope`, `eventType`, `source`, `path`, `pathGlob` (admin), `shareHash`, and `username` (admin). Non-admins cannot override the user filter.

See {{< doclink path="reference/api/" text="API reference" />}} for authentication and general API usage.
