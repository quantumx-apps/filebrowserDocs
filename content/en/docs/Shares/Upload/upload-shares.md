Upload-only shares allow users to upload files without viewing existing content.

## What Upload Shares Include

Upload shares provide:
- File upload capability
- Upload progress indication
- Upload confirmation

Upload shares **do not** provide:
- File browsing
- File viewing
- Downloading existing files
- Directory contents visibility

## How to Create an Upload Share

1. Navigate to the directory where uploads should go
2. Click on the "Share" button in the actions menu
3. Set **Share Type** to `"upload"`
4. Configure the desired options
5. Click "Create" to generate the share link
6. Copy the generated link and share it with others

## Basic Example

```json
{
  "shareType": "upload",
  "path": "/submissions",
  "source": "files"
}
```

## Use Cases

### Homework/Assignment Submissions
Collect student assignments without allowing them to see other submissions.

### Resume/Application Collection
Allow job applicants to upload resumes without viewing other applications.

### Event Photo Gathering
Collect photos from event participants without exposing all submissions.

### Client File Submissions
Allow clients to upload documents, designs, or other files securely.

### Anonymous Feedback with Attachments
Enable file uploads for anonymous feedback or reports.

## Public Access

Upload shares are accessible via:
```
/public/share/{hash}
```

Users see an upload interface but cannot browse or download existing files.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Set Expiration Dates** - Automatically close submission windows
2. **Use Password Protection** - Prevent unauthorized uploads
3. **Limit to Specific Users** - Use `allowedUsernames` for internal submissions
4. **Require Authentication** - Use `disableAnonymous: true` for logged-in users only
5. **Custom Instructions** - Use banner to provide upload guidelines
