Password authentication uses the typical `username` and `password` to login a user. Password authentication also supports **Signup**, **recaptcha**, and **Two-Factor Authentication** features.

## Basic Configuration

```yaml
auth:
  methods:
    password:
      enabled: true
      minLength: 8
      signup: false
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable password authentication |
| `minLength` | `5` | Minimum password length |
| `signup` | `false` | Allow user self-registration |
| `enforcedOtp` | `false` | Require all password users to enable Two-Factor Authentication |

## With User Signup

```yaml
auth:
  methods:
    password:
      enabled: true
      minLength: 12
      signup: true
```

## With reCAPTCHA

```yaml
auth:
  methods:
    password:
      enabled: true
      signup: true
      recaptcha:
        key: "your-site-key"
        secret: "your-secret"  # Use environment variable
```

## Set Admin Password

If password authentication is enabled, by default filebrowser will create a default `admin` user. This admin user is uniquely able to have the password set by the config. This happens automatically on startup if you specify an admin password via environment variable or config file.

### Best practice - use environment variable:

```bash
export FILEBROWSER_ADMIN_PASSWORD="secure-password"
```

### Config based admin password

```
auth:
  adminUsername: admin
  adminPassword: admin # if set it will get reset on startup.
```

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to password-based logins by requiring a time-based one-time password (TOTP) in addition to the username and password.

Two-Factor Authentication is **only available for password authentication users**. It does not apply to proxy or OIDC authentication methods.
{{% /alert %}}

### Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication

- **Enhanced Security**: Even if a password is compromised, attackers cannot access the account without the 6-digit code
- **Protection Against Phishing**: 2FA codes are time-limited and cannot be reused
- **Compliance**: Meets security requirements for many organizations and regulations
- **User Control**: Users can enable or disable 2FA from their profile settings unless `enforceOtp` is configured in the server config.

### How It Works

1. **Setup**: User enables 2FA in their profile settings
2. **QR Code**: A QR code is displayed that can be scanned with authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.)
3. **Verification**: User enters a 6-digit code from their authenticator app to complete setup
4. **Login**: After entering username and password, users with 2FA enabled must enter the current 6-digit code from their authenticator app
5. **Time-Based**: Codes refresh every 30 seconds and are valid for 2 minutes

### Configuration

#### Generate TOTP Secret

Before enabling 2FA, you must generate a secure encryption key for TOTP secrets. This key encrypts user TOTP secrets in the database.

Generate a secure random key using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Add the generated key to your configuration:

```yaml
auth:
  totpSecret: "your-generated-key-here"  # Use environment variable for security
```

{{% alert context="warning" %}}
**Security Best Practice**: Store the `totpSecret` in an environment variable rather than in the config file:

```bash
export FILEBROWSER_TOTP_SECRET="your-generated-key-here"
```
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert context="warning" %}}
**Important**: Changing the `totpSecret` after users have enabled 2FA will make all active users with 2FA enabled unable to sign in. An admin user would need to reset/disable user's 2FA in order for users to login -- or use CLI to reset a user's password which also resets 2FA. 

- (preferred) Admin: User Management → Edit user → Disable 2FA
- CLI: perform password reset on a user {{< doclink path="reference/cli/#password-reset" text="CLI password reset" />}}

{{% /alert %}}

#### Enforce Two-Factor Authentication

Require all password users to enable 2FA:

```yaml
auth:
  methods:
    password:
      enabled: true
      enforcedOtp: true  # All password users must enable 2FA
```

When `enforcedOtp: true`:
- New password users must set up 2FA before they can log in
- Existing password users without 2FA cannot log in until they enable it
- Users are prompted to set up 2FA on their first login after enforcement is enabled

### User Management

#### Enable 2FA (User)

Users can enable 2FA from their profile settings:

1. Go to **Profile** → **Security**
2. Click **Enable 2FA** or **Generate New OTP**
3. Scan the QR code with an authenticator app
4. Enter the 6-digit code to verify and complete setup

#### Admin Management

Administrators can manage 2FA for any user:

1. Go to **User Management**
2. Edit the user
3. In the user edit dialog, toggle **2FA** on or off
4. Click **Generate New OTP** to reset a user's 2FA (useful if they lost their device)

#### Reset 2FA via CLI

If a user loses access to their authenticator device, administrators can reset their password and 2FA using the CLI. See {{< doclink path="reference/cli/#password-reset" text="CLI password reset" />}} for details.

{{% alert context="warning" %}}
Resetting a user's password via CLI also clears their Two-Factor Authentication. The user will need to set up 2FA again after logging in with the new password.
