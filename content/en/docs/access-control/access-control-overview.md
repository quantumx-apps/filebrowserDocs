# Access control in FileBrowser Quantum

FileBrowser combines three separate ideas. Together they decide whether someone can see a source, open a path, and perform actions there:

1. **User permissions** — Global capabilities that apply **across** sources: **admin**, **api**, **share**, and **realtime**. File operations (view, download, modify, create, delete) are **not** global; see per-source permissions below.
2. **Per-source permissions** — For each source in a user's **scopes**, what they may do with files in that source: **view**, **download**, **modify**, **create**, and **delete**. These are configured in User Management on each scope row (v2.0.0+).
3. **Source-level access** — Whether the user even **has** a given source (scopes and defaults such as {{< doclink path="configuration/sources/" text="source configuration" />}}, including `defaultEnabled` and `denyByDefault`). This is **broad**: it gates the whole source or the user’s subtree under it, not individual paths inside the tree.
4. **Access control rules** — **Additional, path-specific** allow/deny rules for directories under a source, optionally scoped to users or groups. Use these when you need fine control (“this folder, for this user or group”) rather than changing per-source permissions or whole-source defaults.

Access rules refine **which paths** under a source are reachable once the user already has that source and sufficient **per-source permissions** for the action.

**Access rules are not file permissions.** Allow/deny rules control path visibility. They do **not** replace **create**, **modify**, or **delete** on the user's scope — those are configured in **User management** (per user) and **Access management** (defaults and enforce). See {{< doclink path="features/user-permissions/" text="User permissions" />}}.

**v2.0.0 behavior change**

Starting in **v2.0.0**, file-operation permissions are **per source** (on each user scope), not global checkboxes on the user. Global permissions are **admin**, **api**, **share**, and **realtime** only. **`view` is a new permission type** — in v1.x, browsing a source was always allowed once the user had that scope; v2.0.0 adds an explicit **view** grant (migration sets it to **true** on existing scopes). After upgrading, confirm each user's scopes in **User Management** — migration copies former global file permissions onto every scope, but requirements for WebDAV, API, and the UI now check the **source you are using**.

Access rules for shares apply based on the user that created the share.

FileBrowser Quantum access rules differ entirely from those in the original FileBrowser. Rules do not carry over when migrating from the legacy project and must be recreated.

**Keep reading this page** for how path-based rules are evaluated, how they combine with `denyByDefault`, and worked examples. For the full rule-type reference and precedence details, see {{< doclink path="access-control/rules/" text="Access rules" />}}.

## Source default behavior

A user's access to files depends on:

1. **User scope** — Users do not see or use a source until it is part of their scopes. New users can get sources automatically when {{< doclink path="configuration/sources#defaultenabled" text="defaultEnabled is true for that source" />}}, or an admin can assign sources in user management.
2. **`denyByDefault`** — With a source scope, paths are normally reachable unless the source sets `denyByDefault: true`. Then the user can still see that the source exists, but file access requires explicit **allow** rules for the paths they need.
3. **Access rules** — Per-path allow/deny (and deny-all) rules for users or groups, as described below.

## How access rules work

Directory-level control uses **allow** and **deny** rules attached to paths under a source. When someone accesses a file or directory, evaluation proceeds in this order:

1. **Direct path** — Rules that match the exact path are considered first.
2. **Parent paths** — If nothing applies directly, parent directories are walked toward the root until a matching rule appears or the tree ends.
3. **Default** — If no rule applies along that chain, access follows the source default (allow unless `denyByDefault` is enabled).

## Rule precedence and overriding

More specific paths override broader ones: a rule on `/folder/subfolder` wins over a rule on `/folder`.

**Allow** overrides **deny** when both would apply.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic deny

- **Rule:** Deny user `graham` access to `/`.
- **Result:** `graham` cannot access any files or directories under that scope.

### Example 2: Overriding a deny with an allow

- **Rule 1:** Deny user `graham` access to `/`.
- **Rule 2:** Allow user `graham` access to `/subpath`.
- **Result:** `graham` can only use `/subpath` and its subdirectories.

### Example 3: Deny-all as a blacklist

- **Rule:** Deny-all on `/vip`.
- **Result:** No one can access `/vip` until an explicit **allow** rule overrides it for a given user or group.

## Configuration

Access rules are configured in the admin UI or via the API: per user or group, per directory, allow/deny/deny-all, with more specific paths overriding broader ones.
