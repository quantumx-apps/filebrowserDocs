## About

The file watcher tool is similar to "watch" on linux. It displays the `last x` lines of a text file each `x seconds`. If a file is not a text-like file, it will show the basic file information such as size and date modified.

You can find this tool at `/tools/fileWatcher` or by navigating to a file in FileBrowser and choosing "watch" from the overflow menu.
