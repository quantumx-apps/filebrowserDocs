## About

The file size analzyer tool is useful for identifying your largest files and giving a wiztree-like experience.

## Example

Here is an example search:

<img width="750" src="/images/tools/fileSizeAnalyzerResults.png">

The above result was afer searching for files over 50MB

{{% alert context="info" %}}
You may see results showing an incomplete warning, this means it already found the limit number of items to show. You would want to narrow your results to get an accurate result, this would either be by increasing the minimum size or by chosing a more specific folder path.
{{% /alert %}}

You can hover and view information for each square visualized and also click the square to go to the item in FileBrowser.

The features and functionality will get updated as new versions are released. This is a simple "nice to have" feature, but is not yet fully featured.

You can also directly navigate to this feature by going to the `/tools/sizeViewer` path.
