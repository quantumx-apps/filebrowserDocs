Tools have been available since version `v1.1.x`, with new tools being added to each version. You can access tools from two methods:


## Access by URL
You can directly navigate to the tools overview page by going to the `/tools` path instead of `/files`, for example `http://yourserver/tools`

The above will show a page that has this:

## Access by sidebar links

You can also set a tools link in your sidebar by clicking the edit customize button and select a new tool:

<img width="500" src="/images/tools/selection.png">

Choosing "tools" will add a link to the tools overview page.
