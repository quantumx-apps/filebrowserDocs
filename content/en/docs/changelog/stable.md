{{% alert context="warning" %}}
**Breaking changes moving from 1.1.x to 1.2.x:**
- if you use global indexing rules, they have changed format -- see {{< doclink path="advanced/source-configuration/conditional-rules/" text="conditional rules" />}}.
{{% /alert %}}

**Security**:
 - Patched Stored XSS in public share page via unsanitized share metadata (text/template misuse) ([GHSA-r633-fcgp-m532](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/security/advisories/GHSA-r633-fcgp-m532)).

**New Features**:
 - "Divider" option in sidebar links to add a text or divider between links ([issue #1875](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1875)).

 - If you use global indexing rules, they have changed format -- see {{< doclink path="advanced/source-configuration/conditional-rules" text="conditional rules" />}}.

 - Docker now uses the default config `/home/filebrowser/data/config.yaml` unless otherwise configured using `FILEBROWSER_CONFIG=/home/filebrowser/config.yaml` env var to set as previously default location -- see {{< doclink path="getting-started/docker/#basic-setup-with-docker-compose" text="getting started docs" />}}.

Also see the docs for {{< doclink path="tools/overview" text="tools" />}} if you weren't aware of the features!
{{% /alert %}}

This is a major version update with many changes which could cause unexpected behavior. Upgrades should proceed with caution and report any undesirable behavior. See the changes over {{< doclink path="changelog/stable/#v113-stable" text="v1.1.3-stable" />}} below:

**New Features**:
 - SQLite-based indexing.
   - reduced memory usage, higher CPU and IO usage.
   - index persistence between restarts requires {{< doclink path="configuration/server/#cachedir" text="persistent cacheDir" />}}.
 - New tool: Realtime File Watcher -- Low latency if user has realtime permissions ([issue #917](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/917)).
 - Breadcrumbs act as a drop area ([pr #1785](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/pull/1785))
 - Access control works with individual files too.
 - Conditionally hide symbolic links as indexing rule config ([issue #1540](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1540))
 - Search multiple sources at once ([issue #848](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/848))
 - File uploads resume from bad internet connection ([issue #1599](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1599))
 - Chunked downloads - optionally enabled in settings or `userDefaults` -- fix for `524` errors on cloudflare ([issue #1502](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1502)).
 - Made size calculation consistent: defaults to "size on disk" style to mimic `du -sh`, and allows config `source.config.useLogicalSize: true` for 0 size folders and actual size file sizes. ([issue #1266](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1266)).
 - Allow deleting selected duplicates from duplicate finder ([issue #1659](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1659)).
 - Share changes:
   - Opengraph support for shared links.
   - Allow adding "share settings" option to customizable sidebar links ([issue #1825](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1825)).
   - File picker for share favicon and banner icon.
   - Allow disabling "Login button" for shares ([issue #1673](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1673))
 - Global disable onlyoffice editor via `*` file option to disable all files for a specific user ([issue #1533](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1533)).
 - Resizable sidebar ([pr #1896](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/pull/1896))

   metadata of the current playing media if available ([pr #1917](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/pull/1917)).

**Notes**:
 - `server.cacheDirCleanup` defaults to `false` instead of `true`. For docker, you would still need to mount a cacheDir volume to persist cache between restarts.
 - Indexing rules have been streamlined, see [docs](https://filebrowserquantum.com/en/docs/advanced/source-configuration/conditional-rules/). The previous style is deprecated but still functional.
 - Improved listing load times for directories with metadata -- a two-pass approach. First a fast load to get the listing items, then a second api request to include metadata.

 - Updated download API to use repeated `file` query param for path instead of `files` with comma. See swagger for details  ([issue #1881](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1881))
 - Better text file content detection ([issue #1726](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1726))
 - More url encoding changes for API which should make things more consistent. Open issues if you see path/source not found errors.
 - Adjustments to the startup behavior for sqlite index for reusing the previous database on startup.
 - `CTRL + B` disables sticky sidebar forever ([issue #1869](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1869))
 - Sharing a link for uploads - folder/file access and UX polishing ([issue #1902](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/1902)).
 - Improved listing view and scrolling performance.

## v1.0.0-stable

{{% alert context="info" %}}
This is the initial stable release -- based on [v1.0.1-beta](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/releases/tag/v1.0.1-beta)

Wondering whether to use stable or beta? [Read this](https://filebrowserquantum.com/en/docs/getting-started/version/)

- **Stable** will get slower updates and will lag behind on features. This means stable will be _much less_ prone to surprise behavior from new changes.

- **Beta** is still the best option for those that can tolerate new features and the possible odd behaviors and bugs that might come from them.
{{% /alert %}}
